1- Tool chaining? Connecting multiple AI tools so output from one becomes input to the next.

2- Why combine tools? Creates more powerful applications than any single tool alone.

3- Challenges? Error handling, latency, data format mismatches, cost management.

4- Orchestration vs composition? Orchestration = smart workflow management; Composition = simple tool connections.

5- Handle failures? Implement retries, fallbacks, and circuit breakers.

6- What is LangChain? A framework that makes it easier to chain AI components together.

7- Monitor latency? Track time for each step, set timeouts, use monitoring tools.
